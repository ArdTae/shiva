shiva - It is a decentralized messaging method with the ability to be either completely P2P or not.
# Information 
shiva - The service is intended and developed with the aim of doing the impossible: giving the user absolute freedom of action and opportunity and leaving the user with his personal and inviolable anonymity and security. The service is partially decentralized, what does this mean?
means that the service has the ability to use both a completely decentralized method (pure P2P) and partial P2P.
What is partial P2P?
This is a mode in which a person is given the opportunity to find an interlocutor from open sources (which are available to all shiva users), it is a kind of replacement for finding friends in well-known social networks, but for this a person has to pay by storing some data on the server.
# what information does the server store
In the absolute P2P method, the server, as the name suggests, does not store a single bit of information about the user, but in the non-absolute method, there is some information. The server collects and encodes the IP, port to which the connection occurs, stores it in encoded form, it is also worth considering that the server creates a dependency between the dynamic nickname and your data.
A dynamic nickname is a solution to the OSINT problem - knowing only a nickname, you can find out almost everything about a person, the main thing is to find the right open databases (or closed ones, where the effect is likely to be higher), because shiva does not connect a single nickname with a single person (his data), with each session a person gets a new nickname.
# Usage 
Absolute P2P:
In this mode, you have two options how you can connect:
1. Be an initiating client
2. Be a listening client.
Since you are connecting P2P, this means that you are not connecting to servers, you are connecting directly to the interlocutor, but in absolute P2P mode, you do not have the opportunity to conveniently find out the IP, PORT of the connection inside the application, so you will have to connect knowing the data in advance.
